 I employ a deep learning-based prediction model using minute-by-minute trading data from the Hong Kong stock market over a period of nearly one month. We focus on predicting stock index futures (HSI) and compare the performance of our model with other methods. This choice is driven by two factors. Firstly, most existing studies on stock price prediction primarily revolve around the U.S. market, with limited research on the Hong Kong stock market. Secondly, deep learning is particularly suited for price prediction in stock index futures due to its higher prediction accuracy for shorter intervals. Furthermore, in short-term trading, stock index futures have the potential to generate greater profits compared to regular stock fluctuations.
